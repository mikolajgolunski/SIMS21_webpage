# SIMS21 conference website

A conference portal with many pages, newsletter subscription and unsubscription, user registration, registration for the conference including uploading abstracts, user panel showing most needed information for a registered user, abstracts viewer, administration panels allowing for relatively easy interaction with most of the data gathered, and probably a few more features that I cannot remember at the moment.

Server side done in PHP. Database in MySQL. Front side in HTML and CSS with some bits in Javascript.

Texts and images provided by the conference organizers, design done mainly by organizers with my help, everything else done by me alone from scratch (with some modifications added by conference organizers).

I can show the code as it is long after conference has finished and the code probably won't be used anymore. Moreover, some crucial parts became obsolete and would need to be rewritten using up-to-date solutions. Still, before publishing, I deleted hopefully all parts that could be somehow dangerous, such as logins, passwords, and personal data that wasn't freely available at the public conference website.

As of February 2023 some version of the website is partially working at https://www.sims.confer.uj.edu.pl/general.php (though the certificate is not updated and "index" site does not load). Unfortunately the most interesting parts such as user registration, user panels and admin panels are not available. It may be deleted anytime.

I do not plan to host a showcase site unless there is a need for it.
