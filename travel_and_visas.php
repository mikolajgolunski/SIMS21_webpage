Immediately after boarding you should put the ticket through the ticket puncher and keep it till you reach your destination.</p>

              <p>A 20-minutes ticket allowing for changing lines costs 2.8&nbsp;z&#322;oty (PLN), its 40-minutes equivalent is 3.8&nbsp;z&#322;oty (in fact it is the same one as a one-way ticket, you can use at either as a one-way ticket with no time limit or as a 40-minute ticket while changing lanes), an hourly one 5&nbsp;z&#322;oty, and 90-minute ticket has been priced at 6&nbsp;z&#322;oty. The prices of unlimited-travel passes for all municipal buses and streetcars have been set at 15&nbsp;z&#322;oty for a 24-hour ticket, at 24&nbsp;z&#322;oty for a 48-hour one, and at 36&nbsp;z&#322;oty for a 72-hour pass, while a seven-day unlimited-travel ticket costs 48&nbsp;z&#322;oty. Tickets are valid for the stated period starting with their first punching on a bus or a tram (don't punch your ticket any more till its expiration).</p>

              <p>All of the above-mentioned tickets are good for municipal bus services within the city limits only. A one-way ticket for buses going beyond the administrative boundaries of Krak&oacute;w - bus numbers from 200 to 304 - costs 4&nbsp;z&#322;oty (so-called &quot;bilet aglomeracyjny&quot;).</p>
