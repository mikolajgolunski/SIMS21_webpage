He attained his PhD in chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 2011, under Mary L. Kraft, where his graduate work focused on using secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS and NanoSIMS) in conjunction with atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy for multi-technique correlative analysis of supported lipid membranes. Afterward, he received a US National Research Council Postdoctoral Associateship to work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology under Anne L. Plant, where he studied how eukaryotic cells respond to changes in the physicochemical properties of their extracellular environment, using force microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and ToF-SIMS. In 2013, he joined the Mass Spectrometry Group at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, which is located on the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory campus. Currently, he focuses on developing new mass spectrometry imaging instrumentation and capabilities to elucidate chemical interactions occurring within microbial communities, soils, and the rhizosphere. These capabilities include NanoSIMS and FTICR-SIMS, as well as other molecular imaging mass spectrometry sources.</p>

              <p><img src="img/nominations/fisher_small.jpg" alt="Gregory L. Fisher" width="100" height="165" class="nominee_img"><span class="nominee_name">Gregory L. Fisher</span> is a Principal Scientist at Physical Electronics specializing in TOF-SIMS applications and instrument development. Greg attended college at the University of Wisconsin - LaCrosse where he earned B.S. degrees in Chemistry and Physics. He went on to study at the Pennsylvania State University where he earned his Ph.D. in Chemistry. While at Penn State, Greg participated in the development of TOF-SIMS analytical instruments as well as research concerning the fundamental physics of ion-solid interactions. He was independently funded and used TOF-SIMS to probe the dynamics of metal atom reactions at functionalized surfaces, pushing the limits of detection at high mass resolution. His research made extensive use of XPS and RAIRS in addition to TOF-SIMS analysis. Greg was at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for two years as a Post-Doctoral Researcher and for five years as a Staff Scientist. He was primarily engaged in thin film growth and surface characterization by XPS, AES and RAIRS for the development of reactive targets used in the high explosive reaction chemistry via ultrafast laser-excited spectroscopy (HERCULES) project. While at LANL, Greg was at the forefront of the use of cluster ion beams as analytical probes for TOF-SIMS analysis. He established the use of a C60 analytical ion beam in high sensitivity measurements to understand the effects of ionizing radiation on the chemical properties of polymers. Since joining Physical Electronics, Greg’s activities have included the application and optimization of cluster ion beams in TOF-SIMS analysis for 2D and 3D characterization of organic and inorganic materials, and the development of 3D imaging by FIB-TOF tomography. An underlying theme of Greg’s work has been the development of TOF-SIMS as a practical and reliable tool for biological and bio-materials analysis. A hallmark has been the development and introduction of TOF-SIMS Parallel Imaging MS/MS. This tandem MS imaging capability enables unambiguous composition and structure elucidation of molecules without sacrificing speed or performance in TOF-SIMS or tandem MS imaging. Greg is one of four patent holders on this new TOF-SIMS technology.</p>

              <p><img src="img/nominations/szakal_small.jpg" alt="Christopher Szakal" width="100" height="100" class="nominee_img"><span class="nominee_name">Christopher Szakal</span> has been a research chemist in the Materials Measurement Science Division at NIST since 2006. He received his B.S. in Chemistry from Muhlenberg College (Allentown, PA) in 2001, and attained his Ph.D. in Chemistry from The Pennsylvania State University in 2006 while working with Nicholas Winograd and strongly collaborating with Barbara Garrison, Andreas Wucher, Zbigniew Postawa, John Vickerman, and Andrew Ewing. His SIMS background was augmented while at NIST with additional techniques within ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AI-MS), such as DESI, and his recent work has involved both ToF-SIMS and magnetic sector SIMS variants. His research has covered a wide range of scientific disciplines, fundamental studies, and applications of SIMS, leading to more than 30 publications in a variety of high-quality journals. His current work at NIST is focused on three areas: 1) the surface chemistry of nanomaterials, including the use of precision inkjet printing to prepare suitable samples for SIMS, 2) approaches for quantitative and precise elemental measurements in microparticles and single biological cells as small as one micrometer, and 3) multi-technique-based measurement science development to support those aims, including the combination of ToF-SIMS and large geometry (LG)-SIMS to provide a more comprehensive data set than either method could provide alone.<br>
              Christopher served as a member of the AVS Applied Surface Science Division (ASSD) Executive Committee from 2010-2012 and is the current ASSD Chair, with both positions lending the appropriate type of conference leadership experience that would be required as a successful member of the SIMS International Committee (IC). Additionally, he has served in several program leadership positions within NIST, including those related to research and development dissemination and a separate undergraduate research fellowship program, allowing for the development of skills that would be useful in the endeavors before the IC.

He is a former student of the École Normale Supérieure de Saint-Cloud (former French “grande école” for training secondary school teachers, now located in Lyon) and got his PhD in Physics in 1990 under the supervision of Yvon Le Beyec, and his “Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches” (French post-doctoral degree allowing to supervise PhD students) in chemistry in 2002, both at the Paris-Sud University in Orsay.<br>
              From 1988 to 2002 at the Orsay Institute of Nuclear Physics, his main research subject was the study of the interactions of energetic particles (ions, clusters, molecules, photons) with matter. A first part of this work concerned the mechanisms of energy deposition and energy relaxation of incident particles in an inorganic or molecular target, with a particular focus on polyatomic projectiles. The second and complementary part concerned instrumental developments involving time-of-flight mass analyzers, new desorption-ionization probes, and detection systems.<br>
              Since 2002 he started at Gif-sur-Yvette a project of biological imaging by mass spectrometry, using cluster-TOF-SIMS and MALDI-TOF. This work is conducted in three directions: treatment and use of biological tissue sections, improvement of instrumental methods, and application to in situ studies, like of lipid disorders linked to human diseases or active metabolites in plants, but also, and increasingly, archeological and artwork samples.<br>
              Alain Brunelle is the author of about 150 publications and book chapters and his h-index is of 37, with more than 3700 citations.<br>
              He has been member of the scientific committee of several international conferences and workshops, Desorption 2010 (Seillac, France), SIMS XVIII (Riva-del-Garda, Italy, 2011), SIMS Europe 2012, 2014, 2016 (Münster, Germany), SIMS XIX (Jeju Island, South Korea, 2013), Desorption 2014 (Montreal, Canada), SIMS XX (Seattle, USA, 2015), and SIMS XXI (Kraków, Poland, 2017). He has been President between 2004 and 2006 and is actually again member of the board of the French mass spectrometry society, and has chaired the organization of the French mass spectrometry annual conference in 2001.<br>
              Alain Brunelle is also member of steering committee of the Laboratory of Excellence CEBA (Center Study of Amazonian Biodiversity) and has been representative member for France at the management committee of the past EU-COST action BM-1104 “Mass Spectrometry Imaging: New tools for healthcare research”. He his partner of the EU-FP7 consortium BIOMARGIN (2013-2017) and has been partner of the EU6-FP6 consortium COMPUTIS (2006-2010).
