              <p>For over a thousand years, Krak&oacute;w has been the center of science, culture and art in Poland and this tour explores the historic heart of the city. The tour starts from the Main Market, a large medieval town square, dating to the 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, surrounded by palaces &amp; churches. Here you will find the Cloth Hall (the world's oldest shopping mall at 700 years), the 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century Gothic Town Hall Tower, the magnificent 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century Gothic Basilica of the Virgin Mary, and the small church of St. Adalbert, some of which dates back to the 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. You will visit the twin-spired St. Mary's Church with its famous medieval altar and where, every hour the brave trumpeter of Krak&oacute;w still calls out his warning. Next, Wawel Hill, crowned by Wawel Castle and Wawel Cathedral and the seat of royal power up until the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. Finally, you will return to the Conference Center through Planty Park, which encircles the Old Town, where the medieval city walls used to stand until the early 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century.
